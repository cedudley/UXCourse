  <h3>about the CZU fire</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
    This map visualizes data about home structures in Santa Cruz County that were destroyed during the CZU Lightning Complex Fire from August 16, 2020 to September 22, 2020. <br>CZU Lightning Complex Fire was a major wildfire in 2020 located in California across Santa Cruz and San Mateo Counties. In total, 86,509 acres of land were burned. While tens of thousands of people evacuated from their homes, in total there were 1,331 structures in Santa Cruz County destroyed in the fire, while 2,598 structures were located within the perimeter and sustained damages of varying extents. Meanwhile, 7,735 structures are located within a mile of the perimeter of the fire, some in designated Debris Overflow Hazard Areas. 
  </p>
  <p>
     Many residents have yet to return home or rebuild as the city assesses damages and safety of roads and infrastructure and as insurance companies manage claims. This is all occurring in the midst of a housing crisis, where the average rent for a one-bedroom in Santa Cruz is nearly $2,500.00/month- and in the midst of a global pandemic, where unhoused residents are regularly evicted from encampments. 
    </p>

  <h3>background + sources</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
    As a resident of Santa Cruz myself, I am curious about data that various governmental and environmental agencies collected and made publicly available about the impacts of the CZU Fire. I want to explore these impacts in comparison to existing demographic conditions of the area. 
  </p> 
  <p>
    This map draws in data about the number of existing units in block groups before the fire, percentage of units destroyed by the fire, and the median amount of income spent on rent in that area in 2019. This map visualizes the percentage of units that were destroyed in the CZU fire.
  </p>
  <p>
     The label “destroyed” is defined by CAL Fire and the County of Santa Cruz as structures that were more than 50% burned, leaving them uninhabitable. Data sources include:
