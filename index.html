<h1 id="title">Homes In Santa Cruz County Destroyed By The 2020 Wildfire</h1>
<h2 id="heading">The CZU Lightning Complex wildfire burned from August 16, 2020 to September 22, 2020, destroying 1,477 homes in Santa Cruz County <br> and displacing many homeowners and renters. This map explores data about the residents impacted by fire.</h2>

  <h3>ABOUT THE 2020 CZU LIGHTNING COMPLEX FIRE</h3>
  <div>
  <p>
      CZU Lightning Complex Fire was a major California wildfire in 2020 located across Santa Cruz and San Mateo Counties. In total, 86,509 acres of land were burned. Tens of thousands of residents evacuated from their homes, and in total, the fire destroyed 1,331 homes in Santa Cruz County. 
  </p>
  <p>
      Meanwhile, 7,735 structures (homes, county-owned buildings, and private businesses) are located within a mile of the perimeter of the fire, some in designated Debris Overflow Hazard Areas.
  </p>
  <p>
      Many residents have yet to return home or rebuild as the city assesses damages and safety of roads and infrastructure and as insurance companies manage claims. 
</p>
<p>
      This is all occurring in the midst of a housing crisis, where the average rent for a one-bedroom in Santa Cruz is nearly $2,500.00/month- and in the midst of a global pandemic, where unhoused residents are regularly evicted from encampments. 
  </p>
  </div>
  <h3>BACKGROUND + SOURCES</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      This map explores demographic data about Santa Cruz County residents whose homes were impacted and destroyed by the 2020 wildfire. Specifically, data about average median income, percent of owner vs. renter occupied homes, and percent of income that tenants spent on rent were relevant in understanding the affordability of different areas in the county prior to the 2020 wildfire. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The label “destroyed” is defined by CAL Fire and the County of Santa Cruz as structures that were more than 50% burned, leaving them uninhabitable. 
    </p>
    <p>
      All data is calculated within block groups- clusters of blocks within the same census tract. These are geographical units designated by the U.S. Census Bureau.
    </p>
